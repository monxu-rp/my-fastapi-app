# Practice Project with Python and Hexagonal Architecture

This project is designed to practice and experiment with various concepts and tools in Python, such as:

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Implementing the architecture to promote a clean and flexible structure within the application.
- **FastAPI**: Building a fast and efficient API using FastAPI.
- **Unit Tests**: Including unit tests to ensure the proper functionality of each component in the system.
- **Integration Tests**: Adding integration tests to verify that the different components of the application interact correctly.
- **And whatever comes up...**: As the project progresses, other technologies and techniques are explored as well.

## Objectives

The main goal of this project is to enhance skills in Python development while applying principles of clean architecture and good software development practices.
